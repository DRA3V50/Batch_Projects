## Notes on Specific Files

- **virus.txt**  
  This script can be stopped by pressing `ALT + F4`.

- **Brute_Force_Password.txt & pass.txt**  
  These two files work together.

  ### Instructions for Brute Force Password:

  1. Rename `Brute_Force_Password.txt` to `Brute_Force_Password.bat`.
  2. Open Command Prompt (`cmd`) and run `ipconfig` to find your IPv4 address.
  3. Open `pass.txt` and add your computer's login PIN somewhere in the password list. Save and close it.
  4. Run `Brute_Force_Password.bat`.
  5. When prompted, enter your IPv4 address, exact Windows username, and your login PIN.
  6. The script will then try to brute force your password.

**WARNING:**  
Use these scripts responsibly and only on machines and accounts you own. Running brute force scripts can lock you out or cause system issues.

# Batch_Projects
Copy the coding provided for each individual separately, go to your desktop, right-click --> New --> Text Document, enter code in it, save and exit. rename it by removing .txt and replace with .bat then double click it!

(virus.txt ---> can be stoppped by pressing ALT + F4.)

(Brute_Force_Password.txt & pass.txt are together.)


*** For the Brute_Force_Password.txt, open the Command Prompt by typing ‘cmd’ into the Windows search bar and run the command `ipconfig` to find your IPv4 address. Next, rename the file named ‘Brute_Force_Password.txt’ to ‘Brute_Force_Password.bat’. Before running this file, open the included ‘pass.txt’ and add your laptop or computer's login PIN somewhere in the list of passwords, then save and close the file. Now, run the `.bat` file. When told, enter your IPv4 address, your exact Windows username, and finally your login PIN. Once you’ve done that, the script will begin trying to brute force your password. ***
